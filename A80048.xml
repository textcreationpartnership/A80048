         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:111570:10"/>plea≈øed; for all ≈øuch Courts are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his, and have power under him, to admini≈øter Ju≈øtice to all men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Commi≈ø≈øions and Charters, as well as the <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> and therefore he had his Atturneys, and Sollicitours, attending many ≈øuch Courts. Secondly, (≈øaith he) if a man be <hi>in cu≈øtodia,</hi> any other may lay upon him any action of debt <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becau≈øe (≈øaith he) that he that is <hi>in cu≈øtodia,</hi> ought to have the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of that Court. Now if a man be <hi>in cu≈øtodia</hi> for Fellonie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and an Action for Debt, &amp;c. be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, ≈øhall his priviledge in being <hi>in cu≈øtodia</hi> keep him from hanging (if he de≈øerve it) till he pay the debt? or if he be hanged, and have any goods, ≈øhall the Creditour be paid his debt out of the ≈øame; or if he have any lands, out of the <hi>E≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat?</hi> I believe not. If a man be not <hi>in cu≈øtodia,</hi> but a Ju≈øtice of Peace, or a Grand-Juror, attending Se≈ø≈øions in <hi>Cumberland</hi> or <hi>Cornwall,</hi> what priviledge of this Court doth he need? If he be arre≈øted there, upon a Writ of tre≈øpa≈øs, when he is guiltie of none, is he not more di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced than priviledged by this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111570:10"/>Court? when he is forced to appear in this Court for tre≈øpa≈øs, and nothing declared again≈øt him for any ≈øuch matter, ought he not to be di≈ømi≈ø≈øed for that matter, with co≈øts, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, an≈øwerable to his di≈øgrace and expences, though arre≈øted at the Kings ≈øuit? Shall the King do any man wrong? how then doth the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim hold, that he cannot? Shall this Court abu≈øe his name, to wrong his Subject? Is not Inju≈øtice, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie in a Judge ≈øworn to do Ju≈øtice? Is not all again≈øt <hi>Mag. Chart.</hi> and truth, which is, God him≈øelf?

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111570:11"/>hath the Debtor, that is ≈øo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Court, and its priviledge, but his undoing, and his families, and often his untimely death by famin, and mi≈øerie? Is not that ≈øo occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the rigour, and illegalitie of this Court, an offence of the highe≈øt nature, of Munther and Perjurie? Who gaineth any thing by this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, but the Court, and their Mar≈øhal in extorted Fees, to the dammage of both Creditor and Debtor, and often the ruin of both or either? Why therefore doth the L. <hi>C.</hi> call it a priviledge to the party in Cu≈øtodie, when it appeareth to be no benefir, but prejudice unto him, and that more aggravated, to have more Actions laid upon him for more debts occa≈øioned (perhaps) by his impri≈øonment? What law, or rea≈øon requireth any priviledge to any man for debt, ≈øince this Statute in the 29 chapter, freeth all mens bodies from impri≈øonment, untill they be lawfully tried by their Peers? and no law, but an abortive Statute made 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. and repealed in the 42 of the ≈øame King (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid) gave an Arre≈øt again≈øt Debtors but Merchants and Accomptants?
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111570:12"/>and a Statute made in the ≈øaid 25 year of the ≈øaid King, gave the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors two parts of all their Debtors lands, &amp; all thei goods (except the bea≈øts of their plough) for ≈øatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their debts, which Statute is ≈øtill in force, and daily executed accordingly?

Eightly, Do they not deny Ju≈øtice when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øuch Writs <hi>Gratis?</hi> Ninthly, Do they not defer Ju≈øtice, when they detain poor men that are Bailable in Pri≈øon, while they have ≈øufficient men ready to tender for their Bail, till they be forced to borrow money of other friends, and to ≈øend far, and ≈øtay long before they can receive it to loo≈øe their Bail in the interim, and be forced to ≈øeek others; by which delays, their Goalers Fees increa≈øe, and their Dyer, Lodging, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences draw charges, which they might have ≈øaved to find Bread for their Wives and Children at home; who perhaps are forced to fa≈øt by that means, and to ≈øell, or pawn their Cows, or Clothes for this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, this damnable money, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by a Judge, for ≈øcribling his Infamous name to a Writ, which doth but wrap a man, and his cau≈øe, fa≈øter in his clouches?
